 <h1>Is Cooking Really THAT Easy.. Or is that <em>Only</em> True if You Can Already Cook?</h1>
 
 <p id="important5"> Actually, that's not true! Sure, having some type cooking experince may help. But... you have eating experince, so that's good enough. You know what your favorite things to eat are, and of course, what you hate. Here are a few ways to get more involved in the cooking realm. </p>    
      
      <ol id= "lists" >
            <li><h4><em> Cook with friends!</em></h4> Cooking alone can often times feel overwhelming, especially when youre making more than cereal and toast... So, grab your friends (or roomate(s), I know not everyone is friends with thier roomates.. it's better than no one sometimes) that way you save some time to do other things. </li>
           
            <li><h4><em>Stumpted on what to make for breakfast, lunch, or dinner? (or snacks, or midnight snacks, or anytime snacks...)</em> </h4>Try looking on the internet for pages like, pinterest, that can give you an idea for almost anything when you feel you need inspriation. Pinterest also may have links to direct websites, so you don't have go searching when you want to make kale salad (I've actually never had a really good kale salad before...some people are into that though), you get the idea.</li> 
            
            <li><h4><em>Hate Grocery Shopping?</em></h4> Let's face it, everyone hates grocery shopping, I think. Try making shopping a game! Here's a game I played to make shopping more fun (aka faster). First, make sure you're organized by creating a shopping list. Next, once you're in the store, set a stopwatch right when you're ready to shop. Finally, try to shop as fast as possible in a safe manner! It's fun to see your times and to continuously try to beat it.</li>
        </ol><br>
        
         <p>Now that we've discussed ways to get involved in the cooking realm, let's go over some tips for actually cooking, in no particualr order! </p>    
    
        <ul id="lists2">
            <li><h4><em> Always Read the Recipe!</em></h4> It's easy to watch these cooking shows and feel like you know everything. Trust me, disasters can happen quickly if you're doing things on a whim. So it's best to stick to the recipe!</li>
            <li><h4><em>Use Sharp Knives</em></h4>Having sharp knives are not only more efficient, but safer too! Make sure to keep your knives maintained and replace them as needed.</li>
            <li><h4><em>Learn from Mistakes</em></h4>Even if you're a seasoned-pro, mistakes still happen! If you're just starting out, realize that mistakes are part of the learning process. Instead of getting discouraged, learn from them and move on.</li>
            <li><h4><em>Clean as you go</em></h4>A daunting part of cooking isn't actually the cooking itself, rather the cleaning at the end. The dreaded pasta pot is something no one is a fan of. To help with this, make to clean as you go. Wash dishes and tidy your cooking space as you go, so that you can truly enjoy your dish after you're done!</li>
