<p>
    “My name is Kai Vong and I am a hobby photographer located in Gunnison, Colorado. I have been fortunate enough to have many different experiences in my life that has led me to have a unique perspective for photography. Starting out in 2021, I have taken photos for multiple events, sporting games, landscapes, and portraits (including Senior portraits). If you have any questions at all, please feel free to reach out, I’m looking forward to working with you!”</p>
